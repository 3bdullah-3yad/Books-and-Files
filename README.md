# Books-and-courses-for-ML-and-DL

#### These books and PDF files are the best sample of what I read and took from courses and on websites and they contain topics like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP and more topics.

#### I learned a lot from them, so, I recommend them.

#### You can find them on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eAYEvcnd66wMYQqNXDihIdFwZx5vdLFc).
