# Books-and-Files

#### These books and PDF files are a very small samble from what I read in courses and on websites.

#### I learned a lot from them.

#### In addition to another useful and important book called "Hands-on-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning", I couldn't upload it here because it has a big size, you can download it from [here](https://www.knowledgeisle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-Aur%C3%A9lien-G%C3%A9ron-Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-Tensorflow_-Concepts-Tools-and-Techniques-to-Build-Intelligent-Systems-O%E2%80%99Reilly-Media-2019.pdf).
