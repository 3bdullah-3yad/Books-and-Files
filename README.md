# Books and summaries

#### These books and PDF files contain topics like `Algorthms and Data Structures,` `Data Sciense and Analysis,` `Machine Learning,` `Deep Learning,` `Computer Vision,` `NLP` and more topics.

#### I learned a lot from most of them, so, I highly recommend this special sample for you and this is about my personal experience.

#### You can find them on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eAYEvcnd66wMYQqNXDihIdFwZx5vdLFc).
